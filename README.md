# School_District_Analysis
# Overview of the School District Analysis

Maria and the school board wanted to figure out the next years budget. They are wanting to see how the different schools compared to each other in regards to their current student population, current funding per-student and how their students testing scores rank them focusing specifically on their reading and math results. They also suspect that one of the high schools have dirty data and need to pull that out so it doesn’t throw the data set out of line.

## Analysis Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to quickly filter through a large data set from multiple files. They are needing to be able to see how each school stacked up to each other based on the student population, math test scores and reading test scores. They will use these data points to ensure each school gets the appropriate funding to support their specific student population. They will also be able to see which are their highest performing schools and who are the lowest performing schools. This will allow them to do two things. One learn what the highest performing schools are doing that they can take to the other schools and help improve their performance. Two dig into the lowest performing schools to determine if under funding or poor leadership/engagement is driving the poor performance.

# Results

**1. How is the district summary affected?**

The biggest thing this does for the district is it allows their data to be accurate and have integrity as it removes dirty data. It has very minimal impact to the overall numbers. Example the average math score dropped by 0.1, the average reading score remained flat, Passing math scores dropped 0.2%, the Passing reading percentage dropped 0.1% and the overall passing percentage dropped 0.3%.

**Old Data**

**2. How is the school summary affected?**

Similarly to the district with the exception for Thomas High School. This change doesn’t impact the other schools individual results but does change Thomas High School a little. Their math scores went from 83.35 down to 83.34 or a -0.01 change. Their reading scores went from 83.90 to 83.89 or a -0.01 change. What it does change is it allows their data to be accurate and have integrity.

**3. How does replacing the ninth graders math/reading scores affect Thomas High School performance relative to the other schools?**

Replacing the 9th grade data within Thomas High School had very little impact on the numbers for the overall district. With Thomas High School 9th grade population being a small percentage to the total student population it wasn’t enough to change the overall data by more than a fraction of a percentage. 

**4. How does replacing the ninth grade scores affect the following?**

  - Math and Reading scores by grade

**Math Grades**
Their math scores went from 83.35 down to 83.34 or a -0.01 change.
